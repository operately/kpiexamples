<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">What are Project Management KPIs?</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
  Project Management KPIs are quantifiable measures used to evaluate the effectiveness and success of a project. They provide a data-driven way to assess progress, identify potential issues, and ensure that the project's goals align with the overall business objectives.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Why Projects Fail and How KPIs Can Help</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
  Projects often fail due to a lack of clear goals, improper resource allocation, or miscommunication. KPIs offer a tangible way to track and measure project performance against set benchmarks. By analyzing these metrics, project managers can anticipate problems, manage resources effectively, and make informed decisions to steer projects back on track.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  An effective KPI should be relevant, quantifiable, and aligned with your project's goals. To avoid the common pitfall of tracking too many or irrelevant KPIs, focus on metrics that directly impact the projectâ€™s success. Ensure that your chosen KPIs are actionable, providing insights that can lead to meaningful changes or decisions.
