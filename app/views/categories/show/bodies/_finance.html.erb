  Diving deeper into the realm of KPIs, financial KPIs hold a pivotal spot. They provide a panoramic view of a company's financial health.

<ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 mb-4">
  <li class="mt-2 mb-2"><strong>Alignment with Business Objectives:</strong> The KPIs chosen should directly correlate with the company's overarching goals.</li>

  <li class="mt-2 mb-2"><strong>Actionability:</strong> It's essential to select KPIs that provide actionable insights. A KPI that doesn't prompt decision-making or influence strategy is just a number.</li>

  <li class="mt-2 mb-2"><strong>Relevance:</strong> The business landscape is dynamic. Hence, KPIs that were relevant yesterday might not hold significance today. It's crucial to revisit and revise them periodically.</li>
