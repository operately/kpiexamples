API metrics assess the usage, performance, and impact of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in software products. These KPIs are crucial for understanding how external users and services interact with the API, gauging the API's efficiency, and identifying areas for optimization. Monitoring these metrics is essential for API developers and product managers to ensure high availability, optimal performance, and effective integration with other services or applications.
