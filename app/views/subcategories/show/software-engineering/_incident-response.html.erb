Incident and Response metrics are focused on measuring and analyzing the incidence, response, and management of software system failures or disruptions. They are crucial for understanding how effectively a team can detect, respond to, and resolve incidents. They also help in evaluating the impact of these incidents on customers and the organization, and how well the team learns from these occurrences to prevent future issues.
